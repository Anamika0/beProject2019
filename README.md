ABSTRACT:
This paper presents an eye control system that utilizes eye gaze tracking techniques that might be helpful for limb disabled and/or speech impaired people with healthy eyes, to interact with the digital world. We design a motion function as well as an efficient blink detection function where eye gaze position is used to control mouse movement and a blinking action is used to simulate a mouse click. Eye movement is detected through the use of a conventional camera on top of the computer or laptop. Digital Image Processing makes it possible to capture the images of the eye and to detect pupil with the help of Hough Transform algorithm in order to perform the mouse functions accordingly.
